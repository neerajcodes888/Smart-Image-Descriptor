## 🚀 Usage
To use the Image Descriptor System:

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Upload an image using the upload button.
3. Receive a detailed description of the image.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
The project workflow consists of several key steps to ensure the system operates smoothly and efficiently:

1. **Image Upload**: The user uploads an image through the web interface.
2. **Pre-processing**: The system performs pre-processing on the image, such as resizing and normalization.
3. **Model Inference**: The processed image is passed through a pre-trained AI model to generate a description.
4. **Post-processing**: The raw output from the model is refined and formatted for readability.
5. **Display Results**: The final description is displayed to the user in an intuitive interface.


## 🚀 Future Scope
We have exciting plans to enhance the Image Descriptor System, including:
- Adding support for video analysis
- Improving description accuracy with more advanced models
- Integrating with popular cloud storage services
- Developing a mobile app version

## 🎉 Conclusion
